# Python Programs -  README

## Overview
This repository contains various Python programs implementing different algorithms and functionalities. Python is a versatile programming language used for tasks ranging from simple scripting to complex machine learning models.

## Features
- Clear and concise Python implementations.
- Well-structured and modular code.
- Uses built-in Python libraries for efficiency.
- Follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

## File Structure
Each Python file focuses on a specific task or algorithm, categorized as:
- **Cryptography**: Implementations of encryption and decryption algorithms.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and other fundamental algorithms.
- **Machine Learning**: Basic implementations of ML models using Python.
- **Utility Scripts**: General-purpose scripts for automation and data processing.

## Usage
To run any Python script, execute:
```sh
python script_name.py
```
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Some scripts may require additional dependencies.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries
- Additional dependencies (if required) will be mentioned in each script.

## Best Practices
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for clean and readable code.
- Use meaningful variable names and comments.
